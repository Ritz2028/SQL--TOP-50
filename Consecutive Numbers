Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.



sql:
sleect distinct nums as ConsecutiveNums
from(
select id,num,
lag(num,1)over (order by id) as prev1
lag(num,2)over (order by id) as prev2
from logs)
as sub
where num=prev1 and num=prev2

or

SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.num = l2.num
  AND l2.num = l3.num
  AND l1.id = l2.id - 1
  AND l2.id = l3.id - 1;

@@ 1️⃣ What is LAG()?

LAG() is a window function.

It lets you look at a value from a previous row
without collapsing rows (unlike GROUP BY).

Basic idea
Current row  ←  previous row
2️⃣ Meaning of each part
🔸 num

The column whose previous value you want.

🔸 1

How many rows back to look.

1 → previous row

2 → two rows back

3 → three rows back

So:

LAG(num, 1)

means:

“Give me the value of num from 1 row before the current row”

🔸 OVER (...)

This tells SQL:

“Do NOT collapse rows — operate row by row using a window”

Without OVER, LAG cannot work.

🔸 ORDER BY id

This is CRITICAL.

OVER (ORDER BY id)

It defines what ‘previous’ means.

Rows are ordered by id

“Previous row” = row with just smaller id

Without ORDER BY, SQL doesn’t know which row comes before.
