Rising Temperature
Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
&&&  HERE WE ARE USING SELF JOIN   @@@@

✅ Core rule of SELF JOIN (very important)
In a self join, the ON condition must express the relationship you want to compare.

❌ Why ON w1.id = w2.id is wrong
Ask yourself:
Does id = id represent yesterday vs today?   THERFORE NEVR USE ON PK CONDITION 

For INNER JOIN, both are interchangeable{IE BOTH HE CONDITIONS WVEN IF I WRITE 
 ON w1.temperature > w2.temperature 
AND
DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 




SQL QUERY:
select  w1.id
from Weather as w1
join Weather as w2
on   datediff(w1.recordDate ,w2.recordDate )=1
and
w1.temperature >w2.temperature
